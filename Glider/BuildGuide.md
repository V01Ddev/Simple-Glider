# The Simple Plane

This plane is designed to be easily built over a few hours using 3D printed templates.

The lengths of each template component:

```
    Wing Total:         100cm (20cm, 40cm*2)
    Fusalage:           50cm
    Cockpit:            23cm
    Horizontal Stab:    20cm
    Vertical Stab:      16cm
```

You only need to print one of every template piece, any part that that doesn't have `Template` in their name are integrated into the plane. Here is the number of each.

```
    Fusalage Wing Connector:    2
    Reinforcement:              min 8
```
2 of the reinforcement pieces are used to attach the cockpit to the fuselage. The more reinforcement you add to the fuselage the better. 4 pieces has some twist but should be fine for lightweight electronics.
