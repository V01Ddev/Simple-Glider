# The Simple Plane

This plane is designed to be easily built over a few hours using 3D printed templates.

The lengths of each template component:

```
    Wing Total:         70cm
    Wing Center:        10cm
    Wing Sides:         30cm
    Fusalage:           43cm
    Cockpit:            13cm
    Horizontal Stab:    20cm
    Vertical Stab:      18cm
```

You only need to print one of every template piece, any part that that doesn't have `Template` in their name are integrated into the plane. Here is the number of each.

```
    Fusalage Wing Connector:    4
    Dihedral:                   4 
    Reinforcement:              min 6
```
2 of the reinforcement pieces are used to attach the cockpit to the fuselage. The more reinforcement you add to the fuselage the better. 4 pieces has some twist but should be fine for lightweight electronics.
